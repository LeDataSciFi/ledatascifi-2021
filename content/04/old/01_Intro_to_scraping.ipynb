    "\n",
    "1. **Manually click and download.** The way you would have done it before this class.\n",
    "1. **Let `pandas` download.** E.g. our assignments often begin with `pd.read_stata(<url>)`. \n",
    "    - Did you know? Pandas can often directly read tables on webpages! Try `pd.read_html('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_S%26P_500_companies')`\n",
    "    - `read_html` can only handle basic HTML tables encoded directly in the page (no Javascript, e.g.) and only grabs displayed text -- no URLS.\n",
    "    - You can use the data without saving it to your hard drive if you want. The good/bad part of this is that if the website changes the data, the next time you run it, you'll get the newer version of data. (Unstable, potentially, but also updates automatically.)\n",
    "2. **\"Install and play\" APIs**, which let you interact with a website without specifying the exact API requests. API stands for Application Programming Interface, and it is a way for your computer to send a request (a query) to a server and get some response (hopefully useful data).\n",
    "    - The `pandas_datareader` plug in for Yahoo stock prices is one version of this. \n",
    "    - `datadotworld` was another. \n",
    "    - Kaggle and most of the [data sources listed on our main site](https://ledatascifi.github.io/studentresourcevert/resource-landing.html#getting-data-and-practicing-ml) have API packages for Python. \n",
    "    - I download your peer reviews using `PyGithub`. \n",
    "4. **Manual API queries** for websites without \"install and play\" APIs. Many sites have an API port of some kind serving up the data they show visitors. \n",
    "5. **Scraping the data implicitly on the website.** The last resort. You can't find the API serving the data, but your eyes see it. And you want it, cause websites contain a lot of data, like [GoT's IMDB page](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0944947/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0).\n",
    "    - AGAIN: The last resort.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Wisdom from [Greg Reda](http://www.gregreda.com/2013/03/03/web-scraping-101-with-python/) that applies to all of these:\n",
    "    \n",
    "> 1. You should check a site's terms and conditions before you scrape them. It's their data and they likely have some rules to govern it.\n",
    "> 2.  Be nice - A computer will send web requests much quicker than a user can. Make sure you space out your requests a bit so that you don't hammer the site's server.\n",
    "> 3. Scrapers break - Sites change their layout all the time. If that happens, be prepared to rewrite your code.\n",
    "> 4. Web pages are inconsistent - There's sometimes some manual clean up that has to happen even after you've gotten your data.\n",

    "### Which method should you choose?\n",

    "| Task | Thoughts |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| To \"open\" a page | `urllib` or `requests`. `requests` is probably the best for sending API queries. <br> <br> Warning: lots of walkthroughs online use `urllib2`, which worked for Python2 but not Python3. Use `urllib` instead, and you might have to include a few tweaks. For example, if you see `from urllib2 import urlopen` replace it with from `urllib.request import urlopen` |\n",
    "| To parse a page | `beautifulsoup`, `lxml`, or `pyquery` |\n",
    "| Combining opening/parsing | `requests_html` is a relatively new package and might be excellent. Its code is simply a combination of many of the above. |\n",
    "| Blocked because you look like a bot? |     `selenium` is one way to \"impersonate\" a human, and also can help develop scraping macros, but you might not need it except on difficult scraping projects. It opens a literal browser window. <br> <br> `requests_html` and `requests` can also store and use cookies. I'd recommend you try this before selenium. |\n",
    "| Blocked because you're sending requests too fast? | `from time import sleep` allows you to `sleep(<# of seconds>)` your code. |\n",
    "| Wonder what your current HTML looks like? | `from IPython.display import HTML` then `HTML(<html object>)` will show you what the HTML you have looks like. <br> E.g. if you're using `r = requests(url)`, then you can use `HTML(r.text)` to see the request object. |\n",
    "| How do I find a particular \"piece\" of a webpage | E.g. Q: Where is that table? <br> A: Oh, it's inside the HTML tag called \"table3\". <br> <br> You can search for elements via attributes, CSS selectors, XPath, and text. This will make more sense next class. <br> <br> To find that info: Right click on an element you're interested and click \"Inspect Element\". (F12 is the Windows shortcut.) |\n",
    "\n",
    "### My suggestion \n",
    "\n",
    "This is subject to change, but **I think you should pick ONE opening and ONE parsing module and stick with it _for now_**. `requests_html` is a pretty good option that opens pages and can parse them, and it allows you to use `lxml`, or `pyquery` within it.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can change and try other stuff as you go, but get as familiar with one package as you can (in a cheap/efficient way).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now to contradict myself: Some of the packages above can't do things others can, or do them much slower, or the code is hard to write, read, and debug. Sometimes, you're holding a hammer but you need a screwdriver. What I'm saying is, if another package can easily do the job, use it. (Just realize that learning a new package comes with a fixed cost, so be sure you need that screwdriver before grabbing it.)\n",

    "Also, again, check out  table above on useful packages and tips. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Issue 1:  The jobs are slow\n",
    "\n",
    "In many web scraping projects, a lot of data needs to get scraped, over thousands (or millions) (or billions) of pages. It's unlikely that you can do this all in one session. (What if your WiFi disconnects, or Windows decides to do an update, or the webpage freezes you out for a period of time?) \n",
    "\n",
    "**Solutions:**\n",
    "1. **Write code that only hits the server one time**, and saves the results to your computer. \"Step 1\" of the `search_itunes` example above does that. Then \"step 2\" uses/parses those files without going to the webpages again. \n",
    "2. **You want your spider to resume, not restart.** Ensure that your code can resume where it left off without having to restart from scratch. My usual solution: \n",
    "    ```PYTHON\n",
    "    # as I'm looping over webpages:\n",
    "    if not os.path.exists(<filename this page would get>): \n",
    "        okay_do_the_download() # whatever the function is\n",
    "    # if not, skip to the next webpage\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "3. Your spider WILL fail - you don't want it to stop. I typically use a `try-except-else` block. The `try` part accesses the url/send the API request, the `except` part prints or logs a failure to a log file, and the `else` part only executes the code I need to run after the url request if the `try` code was successful. For example, I could improve the `search_itunes` function:\n",
    "    ```PYTHON\n",
    "    if not os.path.exists(<filename this page would get>): \n",
    "        try:\n",
    "            r = requests.get(base_url, params = search_parameters)\n",
    "        except:\n",
    "            print(\"hey this didn't work! prob print better info than\")\n",
    "            print(\"this string\")\n",
    "            # or... create strings and append them to an \"error_list\",\n",
    "            # which you save to a text file or csv after the code finishes\n",
    "            # and you can look at it then\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            results_df = pd.DataFrame(r.json()['results'])\n",
    "        ```        \n",
    "4. Your spider WILL fail - you will want to know what. You should log failures, warnings, and errors. The prior example can be adjusted to do this well. \n",

    "To find the 2008 10-K, you'd open up a master list of documents which contains variables with enough info to assemble the path to each file, and info about each file. Then you can `query(\"form='10-K' & fyear=2008\")`, assemble the filename, and run your code. \n",
    "\n",
    "This master list must either be assembled before you run your spider (like in Assignment 5), as you run the spider (collect the info and save it as you go), or after the download you run some code one time to assemble it (either using their paths a la `/gvkey_10145/10-ks/2008/934573495-923875934.txt`, or open every single file to extract the info about the document).\n",

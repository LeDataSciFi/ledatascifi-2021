    "# Merging\n",
    "\n",
    "You've already merged datasets. But so far, our examples have been \"well-behaved\" so it was easy to just proceed. But real world datasets are messy (bad variable names, poor documentation) and big, and so merging isn't always as easy as \"just do it\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## A nice overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/03.07-merge-and-join.html) has a wonderful breakdown of the mechanics of merging. You should read it! I'm going to borrow but alter\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important parameters of `pd.merge`\n",
    "\n",
    "Read through the [parameters of the function here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.merge.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "- `right`, `left` - name of your datasets\n",
    "- `on` - what variable(s) to use to match from the left and right datasets. `on = ` a single variable **or a list of variables** you're using\n",
    "    - if the variable names aren't the same in the datasets (e.g. \"ID\" in one and \"identity\" in the other), use `left_on` and `right_on` instead of `on`\n",
    "    - if the variables are the index variables, use `left_index = True` and/or `right_index = True` instead of `on`\n",
    "- `how` - what observations are in the resulting dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "    | option | observations in resulting dataset |\n",
    "    | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "    `how = \"inner\"`| Observations that are in both datasets \n",
    "    `how = \"left\"` | \"inner\" + all unmatched obs in left \n",
    "    `how = \"right\"` | \"inner\" + all unmatched obs in right), right, \n",
    "    `how = \"outer\"` | \"inner\" + all unmatched obs in left)\n",
    "- `suffix` = when a variable is in both datasets, how should we name each. \n",
    "    - **It's a good idea to always use this option and specific the source, because the default option is uninformative! **\n",
    "- `indicator=True` will create a variable saying which dataset the variable came from\n",
    "- `validate` = \"one_to_one\", \"one_to_many\", or \"many_to_one\". Will check if the merge is actually what you think it is. Useful!"

    "## Tips and best practices\n",
    "\n",
    "**THESE ARE IMPORTANT**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What variable (**or variables**) should you be merging on? For example: Should you merge based on the firm, or the firm AND the year? It depends on the observational units in each dataset and the variable(s) you're using as a key. \n",
    "1. What are the observation units in your datasets? \n",
    "1. **Before your merge, examine the \"keys\"** _(keys are the variables you'll use in the `on` parameter)_\n",
    "    1. Drop any observations with missing keys in each dataset\n",
    "    2. How many unique keys are in each dataset? Simply replace `df` and keys in this code:\n",
    "        \n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    len(df[<keys>].drop_duplicates())\n",
    "    ```    \n",
    "    3. What are the observation units in your datasets? What will the observation unit be after your merge? \n",
    "1. **Always specify `how`, `on`, `indicator`, and `validate`**\n",
    "    1. This will force you to think about the observation levels in each dataset you're merging before you try the merge, and whether the merge you're doing is 1:1, 1:M, M:M, or M:1.\n",
    "    2. Guess how many observations you'll have (more or less than left? more or less than right or left?) and then check afterwards. \n",
    "1. **After the merge**, check that it did what you expected, and give it a _good_ name.    \n",
    "    1. Examine the `_merge` variable (value_counts, e.g.)\n",
    "    1. Good names: I often actively name the dataframe to the new observation level. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    _For example, I know exactly how `state_industry_year_df` and `state_industry_df` should differ._     \n"

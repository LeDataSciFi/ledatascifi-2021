#    Model selection: A SHORT menu of models you can try (emphasis here is on thinking through the process of biz prob -> approach -> data -> set up code)
#    "Leakage disasters"
#        yahoo download 200 days of returns for a firm, create returns, then create predictive model (simple lags). then evaluate OOS
#        then do REAL exercise without future info - OOS will be WAY worse
#    pipeline solution

#**The general rule is to never call fit on the test data**
# putting this together
    # import statements
    # test, train = <decide how to split>
    # pipeline = <data transforms, model estimation steps>
    # set up cv (can set up iterable to do OOS! or TimeSeriesSplit, or Snows(?))
    # scores = cross_validate(<>)    # i like this more than cross_val_scores (more info)
